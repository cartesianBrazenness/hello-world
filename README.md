Hello Homosapiens,

2 Creatures are walking in a museum, one parent and one child. They pause by a display where the child starts staring at the display.
The display contains unearthed remains of homosapiens. The child looks up at the parent and inquires about the display. The parent responds, "They are homosapiens, they were the dominant sentient creatures that existed before us". The child asks "What happened to them". Parent - "They were wiped out becuase they believed Facebook, Twitter and Wikipedia had the answers to all of Life's questions".
